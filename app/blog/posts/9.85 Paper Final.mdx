9.85 Infant Cognition  
The Underlying Origin of Space-Time Asymmetry  
Glancing at a map to navigate to a nearby restaurant requires rapid integration of distance and time. Looking at the spatial layout is not enough information because we also rely on a mental mapping of the expected travel time based on the length of the route and routes that we are familiar with. There is other information that helps us add meaning to the 1D trajectory shown to us. Our minds are actively superimposing time onto space to help us make sense of the real world. Processing temporal and spatial information is essential to daily life, not just in interpreting maps. Given the high processing demands on the brain and the efficiency with which the brain carries out translations between domains, it is likely that the brain holds shortcut mappings between domains to represent all of them efficiently, but the precise relationships and interdependence effects are unknown.  
Previous research has considered the connection between time and space domains and demonstrated a space-time asymmetry present between them. Casasanto and Boroditsky (2003) conducted six moving dot and line experiments. The study revealed the pattern that space influences perception of time much more than the other way around, as people are unable to ignore irrelevant spatial information when making judgments about duration, but not the converse.  
What are the theories for why this space-time asymmetry occurs? There are two predominant theories. The embodiment theory argues that this fundamentally stems from innate perceptual and cognitive constraints \- the way our minds and bodies experience physical space biases how we mentally represent time and gives rise to linguistic metaphors. In contrast, the linguistic relativity view points to metaphorical language and cultural artifacts, and the time-space asymmetry present within language, as the major influence on the mapping between time and space.  
Language acquisition research demonstrates that children already face an imbalance between spatial and temporal words. Children learn spatial words, like “long” and “short” earlier than temporal words. The most natural explanation for these patterns is that space is conceptually more fundamental than time from early childhood, and this conceptual space–time asymmetry guides language acquisition. Beyond language acquisition is language’s inclusion of space-time metaphors. Looking ahead, looking back, moving a date up, looking forward to an exciting event, moving the meeting up or back, are all commonly used phrases—there are many more spatial metaphors for time than there are time metaphors for space. Language has long been shown to influence thought, as metaphoric language creates ways for us to visualize abstract concepts and cements connections to shape how it is that we process information (Thibodeau, Hendricks, & Boroditsky, 2017). Thus, we may intuitively understand the asymmetry to be a product of the asymmetry of the metaphors that we live by.  
Research has also shown that different cultures have also been shown to have slightly different spatial representations, depending on their read-write direction and linguistic terms in their native language, while still using an axis with the self as a reference point. In studies done by Tversky, Kugelmass, and Winter (1991) asking participants to lay out stickers for breakfast and dinner in reference to lunch, they all had a spatial correlation that differed depending on the culture’s read-write direction, with English speakers utilizing a left-to-right past-to-future mapping and Arabic speakers, who read from right to left placing their stickers in the opposite direction. The same study was done in other cultures, with similar results (Fuhrman and Boroditsky 2010). If there is a cultural specificity that is reflected in these different schematics for thinking about time, perhaps it is linguistically derived in the first place to allow these additional differences to arise. Otherwise, there would be an unchanging standard for where the time lateral axis is. While this cross-cultural work is insightful, it offers more circumstantial evidence, as the variations between languages and the development in spatial representation could emerge later in development and not conclusively oppose the embodiment theory.  
Monkeys have a symmetric space-time mapping (Merritt, Casasanto, and Brannon 2010), and although there are many differences between monkeys and humans, one glaring difference is that monkeys do not have a linguistic metaphor connecting spatial and temporal magnitudes. This asymmetry could have its origins tied to higher human cognition, language being one of them.  
The embodied cognition theory proposes that the body’s interaction with the environment constrains and regulates the way that we think. For example, a front-back axis is used to describe events in a person's life, and the basis for time being a line laid out like this correlates to the “universal experience of moving forward through space: when people walk somewhere, places they have already passed lie behind them, and places they have yet to reach lie in front of them (Clark 1973).” (Gijssels & Casasanto, 2017). ven children as early as preschoolers show a space-time asymmetry, predating language. The two concepts of space and time are connected in the infant mind. In two looking time studies, infants were able to distinguish between stimuli that size matched their duration and ones where it did not (Srinivasan and Carey 2010), suggesting that they have expectations that spatial and temporal magnitudes should correspond. If it is indeed language as the cause of the asymmetry, then we might expect it to increase slowly over time and intensify later in life, but even older ages show the same asymmetry. Across a wide age range of 5-year old children and native English speaking MIT undergraduates, the results were the same: the spatial and temporal components of events could not be distinguished. Piaget initially theorized that children would get better at differentiating by the age of nine (Sieger & Ellis, 1996), but this asymmetry persists across ages and is consistently observed from 4-5 years of age to 9-10 and even full adults, meaning it could be something that is locked in from an early age.  
Well-controlled lab experiments such as this that directly manipulate spatial information and measure the effect on time perception provide stronger causal evidence towards theories of innate embodied asymmetry. Much of the evidence on linguistic thought asymmetries rely on observational studies which may simply show correlations as opposed to causations. Lab studies can more tightly control the stimuli exposure in a controlled setting, and we can isolate that specific factor's impact on time processing, rather than having other variables at play.  
Some studies looked at language metaphor absence to determine if a space-time mapping would still arise. The Amondawa people, who have not been exposed to cultural artifacts such as calendars, were asked to arrange plates corresponding to different times in the year and the day. They arranged the plates on a horizontal axis, going either from right-to-left or left-to-right. Although lacking in linguistic phrases or layouts for temporal sequences, they still gravitated to use space to think about time. Despite having a robust system of spatial temporal mapping artifacts, they exhibited behavior similar to populations with these artifacts, supporting the embodiment hypothesis. This provides a relatively "pure" test of innate asymmetry separate from strong linguistic influences and is strong evidence in favor of embodiment.  
Embodied semantics come into play with the theory that “grammatical relations are fundamentally locative in nature, and they are, therefore, derived ultimately from notions of location” (Clark 1973). Is this asymmetric mapping one that is produced by the asymmetry in linguistic metaphors for space and time or are both of these reflective of embodiment that causes us to develop a reliance on spatial representations to interact with time? The current study aims to resolve this gap in understanding space-time asymmetry by running experiments on three-year olds. Three-year olds on average are capable of forming two-word sentences and have limited vocabularies, so their language skills are considered to be basic. If the observed asymmetry in older children also manifests in these younger children, who can be thought of having little linguistic influence, it is more likely than not that the asymmetry may be a distinctly embodied trait.  
Participants were 30 3-3.5 year old children (36-42 months) from local daycares in the greater Boston area (15 males, 15 females). An additional six children were eliminated from the study for failure to accurately determine the longer duration or the distance of the control stimuli, because of an inability to understand the interface, or because of a loss of interest in the experiment before completion. All children and their parents gave written consent before participation in the study and were offered a small appreciation toy for their participation.  
 The stimuli were shown on a computer screen. All of the stimuli started with a blank screen, with one car moving across and drawing out a black path on the screen behind it, followed by another car. The car moved for either three seconds or five seconds total in duration and either ¾ of the screen or ½ of the screen. Depending on the task, children were then presented with a question on the screen where they had to select which car moved further or longer.  
Over the experiment, children completed one set of the distance control portion (six trials), one set of the duration judgment (six trials total), and one experimental portion with twelve trials total. The control stimuli had two stages: distance and duration. In the distance task, the two cars moved for the same duration (3s), but one car traveled further on the screen (⅔ of the screen) compared to the other (⅓ of the screen). Children indicated by button-press which one they thought moved farther. In the duration task, the two cars traveled the same distance (⅔ of the screen), but one car traveled for longer (5s) than the other (3s). Children indicated by button press which one they thought moved for longer. Children were eliminated if they did not do these two tasks with \>80% accuracy.  
In the experimental condition, where the independent variable was whether or not distance and time cues were congruent or incongruent. Congruent pairs are traveling the shorter distance in the shorter amount of time or the longer distance in the longer amount of time, and incongruent pairs were mismatched: the car either traveled the longer distance (⅔ of the screen) in the shorter period of time (3s) or the shorter distance (⅓ of the screen) in the longer period of time (5s). In each of the twelve trials, they were first presented with a “base” stimuli as Car \#1, which was a congruent pair of either Shorter Distance, Shorter Time or Longer Distance, Longer Time. Car \#2 was one of the four time/distance combinations from the table below. Each of these were shown three times in random order. Children were then asked to select by button-press which car moved for more time.

| Shorter Distance, Shorter Time |  Congruent  |
| :----------------------------: | :---------: |
|  Longer Distance, Longer Time  |  Congruent  |
| Shorter Distance, Longer Time  | Incongruent |
| Longer Distance, Shorter Time  | Incongruent |

ANOVAS were used to compare both the reaction times and accuracy for the different groups of congruent time and distance cues and incongruent cues. The test performance was analyzed separately from the training performance, and averages were calculated for each of the conditions.  
When asked to compare each stimuli in the training task control condition, the subjects completed it with ease and to a high degree of accuracy. Analysis of the average reaction time revealed that subjects were faster to judge the distance comparisons then with the duration comparison by an average of 0.2s.  
The ANOVA showed that incongruent accuracy was much lower than congruent condition accuracy. The analysis of the average time taken by children to complete the key cognition tasks revealed that they completed the incongruent trials much slower than the congruent trial. For the experimental manipulation, the congruent trials were 90% correct with an average of 2s response time. The incongruent trials were 60% correct with an average of 2.8s response time, and children incorrectly answered that the longer but faster-moving line had a longer duration in 60% of the cases.  
The follow up t-tests showed that there was no difference when there was a short or a long “base” control clip shown. The interpretation of these results and the significant drop in accuracy from incongruent clips demonstrates that introducing the spatial extent incongruence reliably interferes with and lowers the accuracy of the time judgments.  
The observed asymmetry in even children as early as the age of three suggests that this asymmetry is innate, and that, although it has some correlation to the asymmetry, language is not the primary reason. If the linguistic theory were true, the time judgments would be similar across conditions, but this was not evident. The results favor the embodiment hypothesis and imply that our sensorimotor interactions with the physical world strongly influence our perception of time and space. This raises interesting possibilities for which further experiments can be conducted to determine what metaphoric scaffolding our embodied experiences gives rise to.  
 One possible objection to this conclusion is that these two domains pose different challenges to represent, and that this type of spatial and temporal judgment task lends itself to asymmetry. Space might just be easier than time because space is inspectable and visible whereas time is neither visible nor easily memorable (Casanto and Boroditsky, 2008). It relies on a different set of perceptive skills. Although space and time are symmetrically correlated in the world, we may rely asymmetrically on the dimension that is easier to perceive, remember, or reconstruct from physical evidence. Typically, the distance an object travels is usually a good indicator of the amount of time it takes, so exposure to the environment can naturally cement cognitive expectations.  
Future work should test for different groups to assume this finding generalizes. The study could investigate deaf children, who have not been exposed to any spoken language. Though they are exposed to other modalities of language, it presents an opportunity to remove more of the influence of language. Similarly, studying children across cultures is important in order to isolate any linguistic influences or variations that cause this space-time asymmetry. If despite the differences in languages and their cultures, this asymmetry is still present, then it is stronger evidence that linguistic and cultural factors are not the primary shaper of fundamental cognitive differences and that it is more likely to be a universal evolutionary one. Testing these other groups would be more informative if this space-time asymmetry is consistently observed even across diverse languages and cultures. Preverbal infants would be an ideal test group as well to purify the removal of language. Since three year olds do actually have some word capabilities this study is not purified in its isolation of language, infants would be a more pure subject. However, looking time is the main behavioral response in this type of study, whereas three-year olds have more developed comprehension and interpretation abilities. Infant studies would determine if there are preferred mappings in our brain.  
Our study provides strong evidence for a substantive role of embodiment in creating this space-time asymmetry. However, it is important to consider the way these two theories are not necessarily opposed. Both can play a substantive role in the asymmetry and create a “nature” and “nurture” summative effect, where in this case “nurture” is the linguistic exposure.  
If the space-time asymmetric mapping is innate, then there are practical applications for how we can communicate about temporal and spatial reasoning and design systems that optimize for this interplay. Since we rely a lot on spatial schemas, communication and visual systems can be improved to work with and not against the mental linkage. Communicating data and creating visual graphics can be more challenging if there are interference effects. For example, spacing events further apart on a spatial timeline can help represent greater duration between them. We can leverage the knowledge of asymmetric dependency to identify scenarios where people may be misled by spatial properties and reduce inappropriate or misleading correlations. The depths of cross-domain mappings are not known. Are there similar interferences in number? Further embodied mappings in diverse settings deserve to be tested.

Writing this paper was extremely interesting because it is rare to get the chance to think about embodied experience—typically we just live it. In many cases, language does perfectly capture experiences and feels as if phrases keep a record of human experience throughout time.  
Having to design an experiment that was informed by background literature came with its challenges. I initially struggled with the setup of the experiment and knowing the best way to test three-year olds and condense the broad topic down into a specific study. This required me to read more about how researchers had successfully tested monkeys in the past and to consider what different age groups were able to comprehend in an experiment. I also struggled with writing a substantive conclusion, because it felt like I was posing an unresolved question and then claiming to resolve it by picking one of the sides, when in reality the study could prove the other side. This is a challenging topic to make conjectures about because it requires a lot of analysis about the encodings in the mind and feels circular at times.  
Successes included being able to reduce the literature down to two contrasting theories and gaining a better understanding of the tension between them. This was murky to me initially because the research was extensive, especially in connecting metaphors to real-world experience and linguistic thought, but grappling with it in my review with Professor Schulz further pushed me to see the major difference between them. I also arrived at a child-friendly method that would provide meaningful data to the research history for this question.  
In summary, through iteration and background research, I was able to learn a lot about this topic and hope that this paper is interesting.
